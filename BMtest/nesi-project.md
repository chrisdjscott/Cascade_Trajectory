# NeSI Project

Keep track of work done in the NeSI project.

## CMake

**Note:** these instructions are for the Intel compiler; check the main README.md file (up one directory) for different compilers.

Adding the CMake build system makes it easier to build the code without having
to remember different command line options.

On Mahuika load the CMake and compiler modules (ommitting the version will load
the latest intel module):

```
# load the CMake and Intel compiler modules
module load CMake intel/2018b
```

Then make a build directory (can be named anything you like) and build the code
in there, e.g.:

```
# create and change to a build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# configure with intel compiler
FC=ifort cmake ..

# compile
make
```

There is a short and long test case; to run the short run:

```
ctest -R short -V
```

The executables are in the build directory and also in the BMtest subdirectory
underneath the build directory.

## Benchmarks

Unless mentioned otherwise, the benchmarks are run using the command
(starting from the build directory):

```
./BMtest/cctest 25000  # test original version
./BMtest/cctest_matrix 25000  # test matrix version
```

These are equivalent to running:

```
ctest -R "long$"
ctest -R long-matrix
```

except these also check results are correct.

## Initial timings

Initial timings and timings for a version with some of the calculations in the
integration section moved outside the timestep loop, using the Intel compiler
on Mahuika.

| Case                          | Time (s)    |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Initial, ifort                | 254.7 ± 0.0 |
| Precalc, ifort                | 229.8 ± 0.1 |


## Standardising precision

* Remove `(KIND=8)` from `REAL` and `COMPLEX` variable declarations
* Use command line options when building the code manually:
  - default if you don't specify any extra option is single precision
  - if you specify `-r8` with ifort or `-fdefault-real-8` with gfortran you
    will have double precision
* With the CMake build:
  - the default is to build using double precision
  - to build with single precision use: `cmake -DDOUBLE_PRECISION=OFF`

Note, timings will probably be different now.

## Benchmarks after precision change

Timings on Mahuika with Intel compiler (note this is the original version apart
from precision change). Single precision was configured with `cmake -DDOUBLE_PRECISION=OFF`.

| Precision    | Timings (s)   |
|--------------|---------------|
| Double       | 243.8 ± 1.2   |
| Single       | 221.3 ± 1.3   |

Approximately 9.2 % reduction in run time from using single precision.

## Matrix version

There is also "matrix" version, which constructs a matrix at the beginning
and uses that for the integration, instead of recalculating a number of
values. Need to add benchmarks.

| Version                     | Timings (s)   |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| Original, double precision  | 243.8 ± 1.2   |
| Matrix, double precision    | 240.6 ± 1.0   |

Initial results show the matrix version has similar performance. Need to look
closer at the code. In both cases there are optimisations that can be made,
such as taking out the `i * dt`. Will work on these next.

## Other optimisations

Reducing the number of `i * dt` calculations resulted in the following timings

| Version                     | Timings (s)    | Notes |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-------|
| Original, mixed precision   | 254.7 ± 0.0    |       |
| Original, double precision  | 243.8 ± 1.2    |       |
| Matrix, double precision    | 240.6 ± 1.0    |       |
| Original, DP & `i*dt`       | 199.8 ± 0.0    | Fastest so far |
| Matrix, DP & `i*dt`         | 215.7 ± 1.5 ?? | Slower than non-matrix |
| Original, DP, optimisations | 205.3 ± 0.1    | These "optimisations" slowed it down - memory accesses and pre-calculating some values (see optimsations_slower branch) |

* About 22% time saving for best case.

## Comparing compilers

* Intel compiler v18.01 (`module load intel/2018b` and `FC=ifort cmake ..`)
* GNU compiler v7.1.0 (`module load intel/2018b` and `FC=gfortran cmake ..`)
* Cray compiler v8.7.1 (`module load PrgEnv-cray` and `FC=ftn cmake ..`)

Note: the flag to get double precision `REAL` with the Cray compiler was `-s real64`. This was added to the CMake build.

| Compiler           | Non-matrix version time (s) | Matrix version time (s) |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Intel              | 199.8 ± 0.0                 | 215.7 ± 1.5             |
| GNU                | 541.2 ± 0.4                 | 533.2 ± 0.5             |
| Cray               | 219.4 ± 0.4                 | 156.3 ± 0.4             |

* different compilers produce very different results
* more investigation would be required to understand (vectorisation, other optimsations, ...)
* Cray matrix version run time approximately 39% less than original version

**TODO:** verify that Cray results look good - can't compare directly because the compilers all use different random number generators.

## Array jobs

Adding array jobs to run many copies of the same calculation.

See the section in the main [README.md](../README.md#array-job)
o
## Namelist input file

To make it easier to implement parameter sweeps a namelist input file was added
(*params.nml*). Initially a subset of parameters have been moved into this
file. It must be present when running the code (a copy will be placed in the
build directory that can be edited if required).

## Parameter sweeps

Building on the array jobs, it is now possible to do parameter sweeps over a
range of values for a single parameter. Multiple simulations can be run for
each value in the sweep. See [README.md](../README.md#parameter-sweeps) for
details.
